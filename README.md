## About

A proof of concept for automata-based programming in DRAKON and C#.

http://drakon-editor.sourceforge.net/actors.html

The solution contains an actor framework and two sample applications:
- a WPF GUI application
- an HTTP server

Both applications demonstrate concurrency using actors and message passing.
Actors are designed as state machines in the DRAKON-C# visual language.

## System requirements

- Visual Studio 2017
- DRAKON Editor 1.31
